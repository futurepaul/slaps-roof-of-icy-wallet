# "Slaps roof of wallet" 

A toy Bitcoin wallet built with BDK and Iced. Should eventually look like this:

Right now it looks like this:

For testing I use a `coldcard-export.json` from a burner coldcard:

```
Advanced > MicroSD Card > Export Wallet > Generic JSON
```

And my local Bitcoin Regtest Electrs server is [nigiri](https://github.com/vulpemventures/nigiri).

## TODO

- [x] multiple screens
- [x] nav between multiples screens
- [x] file dialog
- [x] import coldcard json
- [x] display some coldcard info
- [ ] create bdk wallet
- [ ] spend money
